<!-- about page -->
<p>
 Hello there,

My name is Rudranil Kundu. As of 2020 I have completed my graduation in Computer Science and Engineering.

I live and work in West Bengal, India. I spend most of my day, experimenting with HTML, CSS and
JavaScript (and its endless list of frameworks). I enjoy coding and the
challenge of learning something new everyday.

So enough of my work and professional experiences, now let's move onto some interesting stuff about me.

So, other than my small scale projects and interest in software developement, I am also a fitness Enthusiast. I have been in this field for about six years and it's an integral part of my life. Everyday I look up for my training session which works as a therapy session for me.

Apart from that I have also been into music and have some experience in hiphop dancing as well.

so these are a few things that I could tell you about myself.
